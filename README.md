FlickrFaves
===

FlickrFaves is a small utility for **downloading high-resultion versions of your [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) favorites to your harddrive.** If you are like me this means hundreds of beautiful new wallpapers at the click of a button! FlickrFaves is a cross-platform utility written in Java.
